Since MadGraph needs as input parameter the mass of the heavy neutrino, two signals were simulated. One signal was simulated with a value of 5.0 GeV for the heavy neutrino mass, while the other assumed 
this mass to have a value of 70.0 GeV. 

In order to study the performance of a variable to reduce the backgrounds, histograms of this variable were made for each signal and background. The type of histograms used in this analysis are called stacked plots. In these histograms each distribution of the variable is placed on the same plot and each one is normalized to the cross section and luminosity. The luminosity expected for the LHC accelerator by the end of 2017 is 50 $fb^{-1}$. This normalization makes possible to compare the performance of the variable among them.  If each histogram is not normalized it will depend on the size of the simulated sample. In this kind of plots, the bins of one background are located above the corresponding bins of the other background. Thus, the total background is given by the curve of the background at the top. The background uncertainty is represented by a dashed line at the top of the background histograms. These kind of graphics are called stacked plots. The plots shown here include just the W+jets and DY+jets backgrounds, because these are very large compared to the $t\overline{t}$ background, and reducing them is already a difficult task.

The analysis started by studying the distribution of different variables after the preselection cuts and some cuts on three variables: number of jets, taus and b-jets. The first variable studied 
was $\vec{E_T^{miss}}$, and its stack plot is shown in Figure \ref{MET_bjets}. The plot shows that the amount of background is much larger than both signals. Moreover, the distribution of the 
variable is similar for the signals and backgrounds. This implies that a cut on this variable would reduce the background in a similar way as it would reduce the signal. Thus, it is not possible 
to find an optimal cut value of MET.

 \end{figure}
 
Next, we studied the distribution of more variables in order to be able to find the optimal cut values. The variables are $H_T$, di-jet mass and the $p_T$ of the tau, and they are shown in the 
Figures \ref{HT_bjets}, \ref{diJetMass_bjets} and \ref{taupt_bjets}. It is possible to see that the distribution of these variables is similar for the signals and backgrounds. As a consequence, 
a set of optimal cuts on these variables that allows to reduce the background cannot be determined.

 Then, all the cuts mentioned in the Chapter \ref{Event_selection_criteria_chapter} are imposed. These cuts include the ones related to the VBF process and the results are showed in the following 
 plots. The variables $H_T$, di-jet mass and $p_T(\tau)$ are shown is the Figures \ref{HT_VBF}, \ref{diJetMass_VBF} and \ref{taupt_VBF}. In these plots, one can see that, after imposing all the 
 cuts the amount of signal and backgrounds reduces drastically.

One fact that can explain the reason why the VBF cuts do not allow to reduce significantly the background compared to the signal is the similar values of mass of the Higgs boson and the Z boson.
The production mechanism of a Higgs boson is 
identical to the Z gamma production mechanism because the mass difference between the Higgs boson and the Z boson is just 30 GeV. Thus, the characteristics of the VBF jets in the events are similar
and it is difficult to distinguish both VBF topologies. In the case that the heavy neutrinos are produced by the decay of a particle heavier that the Higgs boson, this heavier particle must be the
result of the interaction of more energetic VBF jets. Thus, in this case it is expected that the detected VBF jets would be more energetic, which would lead to distinguish between both final states.

Since it was expected that the resulting tau in the signal had an associated track with a displaced vertex, some 2D plots were made using this variable. The value of the impact parameter for the tau was found by performing a minimization process on the distance between the tau and the tracks. That way, the track associated to each tau is determined. 

First, we studied a plot on which the x axis 
represents $\vec{E_T^{miss}}$ and the y axis the impact parameter ($d_{xy}$). This plot is shown in the Figure \ref{ipt1_MET}. The two plots at the left of this figure correspond to the signal events, one 
assuming a mass of the heavy neutrino of 5.0 GeV, and the other of 70.0 GeV. The range of the y axis for both plots is just from -1.0 to 1.0. The left plots at the right of the figure correspond 
to the W+jets background and DY+jets background. These plots have a range in the y axis from -8.0 to 8.0. It can be seen that for our signals the value of the impact parameter is almost zero. 
This implies that it is not possible to make a cut on this variable to reduce the background as it was expected.

The other 2D plots studied is shown in the Figure \ref{ipt1_pt}, where the x axis represents the absolute value of the impact paramter and the y axis the transversal momentum of the tau. As in the previous Figure \ref{ipt1_MET}, the y-axis for the analysis has a range between -0.1 to 0.4. Unfortunately, it is not possible to obtain relevant information from this figure.

Thus, in the end we obtained that our signals of interest have a low value on the impact parameter variable, while it was expected the opposite. Now, possible facts that can explain the difference between our results and what was expected are discussed. In the first place, the samples of signal are small compared to the sample size of background. Both simulated signals consist of 10000 events while the W+jets and DY+jets background samples consist of millions of events. Thus, we have a small statistical sample and it may be necessary to generate more signal events to make a study. On the other hand, it seemed that there was a problem in the generation of the signals because the impact parameter values of the signals only obtained positive values. The former is not expected because there is no reason to believe that the impact parameter has an asymmetric distribution. If this problem is solved, a cut on the impact parameter value would strongly reduce the amount of background.
