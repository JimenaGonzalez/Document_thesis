 \section{Jets}
 A Jet can be defined as a high energy shower of stable particles that comes from fragmentation of quarks or gluons. The initial quarks and gluons in the process are know ``initial partons''.
 Due to the initial partons are colour charged, they can not be isolated singularly (this phenomenon is called ``colour confinement''. Since it is not possible for charged particles to be isolated 
 they must go through a non-perturvative process that converts them into colour neutral particles. This process is called ``hadronization'' and there are different models to explain it. According to 
 the string model, the confining nature of strong interaction increases the potential colour in a proportional way as the distance between the initial partons. When the distance reaches a certain 
 critical value it is energetically favourable to produce a quark pair from the vacuum. Finally, by this proccess the inital colour charged particles are convert into bound colour-singlet hadronic 
 states. \\
 
 Besides jets may display a structure with properties that could indicate which were the initial partons interacting, they are hard to study individually when there is a numerous quantity of them
 in an event. The former is because it is almost imposible to attach all particles in an event final state to a single initial parton. Thus, there exist algorithms which cluster some particles in 
 a final state in a way that it is possible to determined properties as 4-momentum and jet shapes. The objetive of this algorithms is to approximate the direction and energies of the initial partons.
