\chapter{Methodology} 

The objective of this project is to make a phenomenological study that allows the identification of a signal whith the presence of a heavy neutrino in the experiments of the LHC. For this reason, 
the methodology that is going to be use consist in the use of different computational programs to simulate the signal and its background, and after to perform the statistical analysis of the 
simulated data. The programs that are going to be used to simulate the signal are MadGraph \cite{MadGraph 1, MadGraph 2}, Pythia \cite{Pythia} and Delphes \cite{Delphes}. The statistical study 
of the data is going to be develop with the software ROOT \cite{Root}. In the next paragraphs each program is going to be described, including the fundamental physical basis on which the program 
is constructed and its specific task in the development of the project.

\section{MadGraph}

The first program that is going to be used is MadGraph, which is a generator of events that simulates the collisions of particle beams, which in our case are protons. MadGraph is written in Python
programming language. The physical processes that MadGraph can simulate include processes from the SM and from physics beyond the SM that are based on certain theoretical models like Supersymmetry.
This program incorporates diverse physical
parameters in order to include all the necessary elements to make phenomenological studies: it calculates the cross section of a certain event, it generates events with 
strong interactions (including possible decay of particles) and it offers relevant tools to manipulate the events and to make their posterior analysis. Madgraph uses perturbation theory to perform 
production calculations and to generate physical processes. The parameter entries are controlled in configuration files that are called input cards. These cards are use to modify 
essential variables in the production of the events, for example: the type of particles that will collide, the energy of the collision, number of events that are going to be simulated, mass of the
generated particles, final states, among others. At the level of event generation it is possible to make basic cuts of minimal and maximal values of some kinematic variables. Moreover, the lastest
version of MadGraph (MadGraph 5) has an useful characteristic: it can give an output file with matrix elements that can be used directly in the program Pythia. Additionally, this program is fully 
compatible with FeynRules which allows it to be able to generate any new physical model that can be written in the form of a Lagrangian.


\section{Pythia}

The second program is Pythia, this program incorporates a set of physical models to develop the evolution of few-body system into a complex final state with multiple particles. This program 
simulates the processes of fragmentation of quarks and gluons. The former process is called hadronization and it is a consequence of the color confinement, which is the phenomenon that the elemental
color charged particles can not be isolated singularly. As a consequence, when quarks are produced in an event, as the distance among them increases the energy increases too. When this energy 
reaches a critical value, a pair quark-antiquark is produced in the vacuum. The result of this process are neutral color hadrons, for this reason the process is called hadronization. The program
Pythia receives as parameter entry the file generated by the Siftware MadGraph and generates the simulations of the fragmentation process of quarks and gluons.

\section{Delphes}
The last program that is going to be used to generate the simulation of the signal and background is Delphes. This software makes the simulation of a multipurpose detector. The simulation includes a
system of track reconstruction immerse in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic calorimeter, a hadronic calorimeter and a muon detection system. Delphes takes as input file the events generated by 
Pythia and then it makes a realistic simulation of the multipurpose detector behaviour. Due to the proposed analysis includes the systematic errors that can be generated by the detector, it can be 
implemented in the experimental studies at the LHC. The systematic errors can be caused by multiple factors as the resolution of the detectors. Delphes have in mind (consider) different 
characteristics of the event in the experiment: detector geometry, the track of the charged particles in the magnetic field, reconstruction of the event and efficiencies of the reconstruction 
and particle identification.

\section{ROOT}

The analysis of the simulated data is going to be done using the software ROOT. This software was developed by the CERN laboratory. Root is written in the programming language C++ and it was 
designed to analyse data in particle physics. This program provides all the necessary tools to efficiently process big data, make statistical analysis, visualize and store data. The program 
includes a numerous quantity of mathematical and statistic functions, numeric algorithms and methods for analysis of data regression. One key tool ROOT has are the histograms that can even use 
multidimensional data and estimate their density. The histograms can be manipulated, they offer statistical information and can make data regression. The program ROOT receives as input parameter 
complementary information that allows to do the best analysis of the signal: characteristics of the detector or configuration settings that were made in the simulations. Root includes other 
components like a command interpreter that makes quicker the analysis process and a graphic interface which contains a flexible set of tools. The former means that the set of tools can be modified 
using GUI Builder (the graphic interface constructor). This software can be used to analyse real or simulated data that have the same structure and consist of many events.
