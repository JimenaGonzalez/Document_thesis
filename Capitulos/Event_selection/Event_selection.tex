\chapter{Event Selection Criteria}
\label{Event_selection_criteria_chapter}

The analysis of the simulated data started by imposing a minimum value of 20.0 GeV on $p_T$ for b-jets and taus, and of 30.0 GeV on jets that are not associated to taus or b quarks. The minimum values 
required on $p_T$ are imposed in order to preselect the interesting particles. After this was done, it was required a minimal distance of separation between taus and muons, taus and electrons, 
and taus and jets. The former was done in order to ensure that taus do not overlap with other objects, so the performed analysis does not commit errors such as tagging incorrectly a particle.
To do this, one has to impose a minimal value on the variable called minimal separation distance $\Delta R$, which is given by the Equation \ref{minimal_separation}. The minimal value imposed on this 
variable was 0.3 for taus with muons, electrons and jets. 

\begin{equation}
\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{\Delta \eta ^2 + \Delta \phi ^2}
\label{minimal_separation}
\end{equation}

Since it was considered that the event of interest is generated by a process of VBF, in the analysis was necessary to find the two possible jets that are related to the two VBF jets. This was done by 
searching two jets that satisfied the conditions of having a minimal value on $p_T$ of 50.0 GeV and $\eta$ greater that 5.0 each. The condition of minimal values on $p_T$ and $\eta$ is required 
because it is expected that the VBF jets have a large momentum and that they are located at the end-caps of the detector. Then, an algorithm was performed to select the pair of jets that had the 
largest sum of the invariant mass of all possible combinations of jets pairs in each event. Finally, a minimal value of 100 GeV is required for the sum of the jets. That is how the expected two jets from the VBF 
process are determined. From both jets, the one with the hightest momentum is referred as the leading jet, and the other is known as the subleading jet. The required values to identify the VBF 
jets are part of the preselection process.

After the former preselection process is made, we have to find the minimal or maximum values of variables that allow to reduce the background to its minimum. These minimal and maximum
required values are known as cuts. The first cut imposed in the analysis was on the number of jets. It was required a maximum number of 5 jets because the signal is expected to have 4 jets. An
additional jet is included in order to find the best two VBF jets. The second cut imposed was the presence of just one tau, due to the fact that this is a characteristic expected for the hadronic 
signal. 

Next, the third cut imposed was requiring the number of b-jets to be zero. The former is done to reduce drastically the $t\overline{t}$ background because it has in the final state b-jets. The 
following cut made was on the variable $\vec{E_T^{miss}}$: it was required a value greater that 20 MeV. The former is motivated to reduce the W+Jets background. Then, a cut on the absolute value of $\eta$ of the tau of maximum 2.1 was performed. This value was 
chosen because the tracking detector covers the range of $|\eta|<2.5$. Since the reconstruction cones of the taus have a radius of around 0.4, one has to impose a maximum value on $|\eta|$ of 
maximum 2.5 - 0.4 = 2.1 so the reconstruction algorithms are correctly applied in the area covered by the track detector.
  
After a cut on the $\vec{E}_T^{miss}$ variable was imposed, the cuts motivated by the VBF proccess were performed. The first cut guarantees that there are minimum two jets that satisfy the 
condition on $p_T$ to be candidates of VBF jets. Next, it was required that the product of eta between both jets is negative. This implies that both jets are located at the opposite hemispheres,
as it is expected for both of the VBF jets. Next, it was imposed a minimal value of the diference in $\eta$ for both jets, referred as $\Delta \eta$. The minimal value on $\Delta \eta$ was required 
to be 3.8, since the VBF jets should have a large difference in the pseudorapidity value. 


Finally, a cut in the sum of the invariant mass of the VBF jets, known as dijet mass, was made. It was imposed a 
value of minimum 500.0 MeV on the dijet mass, due to the fact that the VBF jets have a large momentum, and this is proportional to the mass.  

The table \ref{preselection_table} shows the preselection values imposed that were mentioned on the initial paragraphs of this chapter. Additionally, the table \ref{Cuts_variables} shows all 
the cuts that were performed on the data in order to reduce as much as possible the backgrounds.
